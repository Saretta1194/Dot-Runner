I decided to create a game after learning JavaScript. During that time, I came up with the idea of recreating one of the most addictive games from my youth. I vividly remember spending countless hours playing it on arcade machines and early consoles. Thatâ€™s when I decided to build my own version of Pac-Man.

The goal of the game is to be fun and engaging, while also bringing back nostalgic memories for those who grew up with classic video games.

## Design and User Experience

### Design
The design focuses on simplicity and retro vibes. The layout is responsive, working well across different devices and screen sizes. A pixelated character and maze-style grid help recreate the arcade aesthetic of classic games.

Key elements:

Bold colors for high visibility

Intuitive UI with clear controls

Minimal distractions to focus on gameplay

Fonts: VT323 - This font is visible throughout the structure of the site.

The following colors were used to give Dot Runner a clean, vibrant retro-inspired look:
