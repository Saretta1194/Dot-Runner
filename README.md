I decided to create a game after learning JavaScript. During that time, I came up with the idea of recreating one of the most addictive games from my youth. I vividly remember spending countless hours playing it on arcade machines and early consoles. Thatâ€™s when I decided to build my own version of Pac-Man.

The goal of the game is to be fun and engaging, while also bringing back nostalgic memories for those who grew up with classic video games.
